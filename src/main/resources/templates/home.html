      <h1>Welcome to new book store</h1>
      <h6>Welcome to our Book Store.
      It was my dream to create a place where we can read our favorite books under 
      a safe shadow and without any restriction we can enjoy reading books. i have seen 
      that in school and colleges the librarian is the most Khaadoos person who shouts 
      for no reason and few people might have banned from Library Like me yesh. Learning
      from that experience i had, i come across many ideas so i made a place indeed an a 
      platform where we can be present online or offline both,
      for those who want to read books we have created a huge place where you can read 
      books which ever you like and those who don't want to read we have though of them 
      they can learn from videos if not we have play grounds theators and cafe area 
      and we have online platforms where you can buy book. Now without taking much
      time i insist all my friends to have a look around.
